## 🐦 Overview
Life is Bamboo is a simple and addictive game where the player controls a person, navigating through pipes to achieve the highest score. The person's goal is to avoid obstacles (pipes) and stay afloat using a jumping mechanic. The longer you survive, the higher your score! 🏆

In this version, you control a person using your keyboard's `Spacebar` or any key, making it fly upwards while gravity pulls it down. The pipes move from right to left and get more difficult as the game progresses.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Press any key to make the bird jump.
2. Avoid the pipes and stay in the air.
3. The longer you survive, the higher your score.
4. Try to beat your high score each time!

## 🌟 Features

- **Scoring System**: Each pipe that passes increases your score.
- **Local Storage**: Your highest score is saved and displayed.
